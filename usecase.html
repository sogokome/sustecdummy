                        <p>The target reservoir was located around few thousands meter deep.
                            Hence, the conventional EM survey method might be insuffcient
                            in terms of depth of investigation.

                        <p>We introduce an innovative method utilizing highly-sensitive SQUID 
                            magnetic sensors paired with an electric bipole transmitter. 
                            These SQUID sensors enable precise 
                            measurement of the magnetic field generated by a bipole 
                            source over an extended time period.

                            magnetic field (dB/dt), SQUID sensors capture all three 
                            components of the magnetic B field. This allows for later 
                            time recordings, corresponding to deeper subsurface

                <h2>Geothermal Reservoir Exploration (Southern Sumatra region, onshore Indonesia)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b><u>Challenge</u> "Success ratio of drilling"</b></li>
                        <p>Electric conductivity is an important indicator of the location of geothermal sources. 
                            Until recently, the magnetotelluric survey (MT) was the preferable method for the geoelectrical 
                            exploration of geothermal systems.</p>
                        <p>MT system is suited for wide area survey, while its drawbacks might be less resolution and accuracy
                            in order to map out accurately the geothermal system and reservoir around few thousands of meter depth.
                            Moreover, the exploration area is located around rainforest and steep mountain area, 
                            which makes it difficult for MT system to conduct an accurate measurement. 
                        </p>
                    <li><b><u>Solution</u></b></li>
                        <p>The use of the SQUID-TEM configuration with line source
                            provides high signal strength and low noise/capability to detect very weak signals
                             (higher S/N ratio). These two when combined, increase the depth of investigation 
                             significantly relative to standard TEM / CSAMT.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is reasonable that the SQUID-TEM could be able to image both the top and
                                bottom of the conductor when it is above about a few km depth.</p>
                    <li><b><u>Result</u></b></li>
                        <p>The two distinct deep conductors, possibly interconnected, were identified at depths of interest expected.
                            The conductor appears to have a surface expression roughly in the center of the inversion domain horizontally. 
                            These conductive zones could be considered indicators of the geothermal source locations. 
                            Thus, the SQUID-TEM survey helped identify the deep conductive anomalies representing geothermal targets in the survey area.

                    <li><b><u>Challenge</u> "Cost Effective CO2 Plume Monitoring"</b></li>
                    <p>Accurately characterizing the subsurface geology and geophysics are 
                        challenging due to 
                        the inherent uncertainties in geological formations. This affects the 
                        prediction of CO2 behavior and its interaction with the surrounding 
                        rock and fluids.</p>

                    <p>Current monitoring technologies may not 
                        provide the necessary resolution or coverage to detect subtle changes 
                        in the reservoir. The costs associated with deploying and 
                        maintaining monitoring equipment, as well as analyzing the data, 
                        can be significant compared to project budget.
                        Hence, cost-effective advanced geophysical monitoring techniques are needed.</p>
                <li><b><u>Solution</u></b></li>
                    <p>The "time-lapse" SQUID-TEM measurements have been made before (i.e., baseline measurement)
                         and after injection of
                        mixture of seawater/CO2 fluid into the subsurface reservoir.
                        The goal was to produce 3D resistivity models around the injection 
                        borehole before and after the fluid injection and determine 
                        the injected fluid's location.
                        </p>
                <li><b><u>Result</u></b></li>
                    <p> The inversion of the post-injection survey data clearly identified 
                        the new conductive zone centered about expected injection depth 
                        and offset slightly to the one side of the borehole. 
                        This zone is interpreted to be the location of the injected CO2 
                        and seawater mixture.</p>
                     <p>This result demonstrates that the SQUID-TEM method represents a 
                        powerful technique for monitoring the injection of conductive 
                        fluids at deep reservoirs.
